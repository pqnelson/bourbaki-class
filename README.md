This is an attempt to get something resembling Bourbaki's _Elements of Mathematics_
in LaTeX form.

The only sectioning commands available are: chapters, sections,
subsections. (Bourbaki is inconsistent with the terms "section" --- in
chapter 1 of _Lie Groups and Lie Algebras_, they call it a "paragraph",
but throughout _General Topology_ they call it a section. I'm adopting
LaTeX terminology.)

The margins are proportional. If you set the geometry manually, it
appears the inner and outer margins are 0.75 inches.

The section and subsection titling is handled to reflect Bourbaki's
conventions. 

The theorem numbering is done _contra_ Bourbaki's conventions: they all
share the same counter, numbered within the section.

# TODO:
- Chapter title formatting
- Article title page
- Equation numbering should be on the left-hand side
